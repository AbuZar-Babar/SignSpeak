## 🎯 Overview

SignSpeak aims to provide an accessible and efficient communication tool for PSL users. The system leverages computer vision and machine learning to interpret sign language gestures captured via a smartphone camera and translates them into understandable text.

**Core Objectives:**
*   Real-time translation of PSL words.
*   Mobile-first approach for accessibility.
*   Lightweight and efficient architecture suitable for mid-range smartphones.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The SignSpeak ecosystem consists of three main components:

1.  **Mobile Application (Frontend)**: A Flutter-based app that serves as the user interface for capturing video frames and displaying translations.
2.  **Backend Server**: A FastAPI (Python) server that handles heavy computations, including landmark detection (MediaPipe) and ML inference (TensorFlow/Keras).
3.  **Admin Dashboard**: A web-based panel for managing user accounts, reviewing complaints, and monitoring system performance.

### High-Level Workflow
1.  **Capture**: User points camera at the signer via the Mobile App.
2.  **Process**: Frames are sent to the Backend Server.
3.  **Analyze**: Backend extracts landmarks using **MediaPipe** and feeds them into an **LSTM-based Neural Network**.
4.  **Translate**: Predicted word is returned to the app and displayed to the user.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Real-time PSL Translation**: Instant recognition of sign language gestures.
*   **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login via Firebase.
*   **PSL Dictionary**: Built-in reference for learning implementation of standard signs.
*   **Complaint Management**: Users can report incorrect translations or bugs; Admins can review and resolve them.
*   **Profile Management**: extensive user profile customization.
*   **Accessibility Settings**: Adjustable font sizes and UI elements.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Currently, the **ML Pipeline** is the active component available for setup and testing.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.9 - 3.11
*   Webcam

### Running the ML Pipeline
Please refer to the detailed [ML Pipeline README](ml-pipeline/README.md) for instructions on how to:
1.  Install dependencies.
2.  Collect your own dataset using the GUI.
3.  Train the LSTM model.
4.  Run real-time inference via webcam.

### Mobile Frontend (React Native)
The Android React Native app is available in:
- `front-end-mobile-react-native/`

See `front-end-mobile-react-native/README.md` for setup and run instructions.
